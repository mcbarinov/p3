# Instructions for AI Assistant

## Important

1. **MUST read README.md file first**. All architecture and project descriptions are only in the README.md file.

2. **Communication language**: Always communicate with the developer and write code, including comments, in English ONLY. This applies regardless of which language the developer uses to communicate with you.

3. **Simplicity principle**: Always implement everything in the simplest possible way, without premature optimization. Simplicity is very important for us.

4. **No backward compatibility**: This is an architecture reference project. We can change any API, interface, or structure without maintaining backward compatibility. Always implement the cleanest solution.
